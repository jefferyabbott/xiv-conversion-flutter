Roman numeral conversion

XIV Conversion is a simple app that converts roman numerals (such as XIV) to arabic/cardinal numbers (such as 14). Why 14? My birthday falls on the 14th and when I first made an icon of the app, XIV looked good. It's short enough to fit on an icon and is unambiguously a roman numeral.

For the past several years while learning how to program, I have been using this utility as my own Hello, World example. Any time I learn a new programming language, I build this app, from scratch. The first version was released in 2013 for iOS. Since then, I have created and released versions for Android (Java) and the web (JavaScript).

This version is my first publish Flutter project, for iOS and Android.
